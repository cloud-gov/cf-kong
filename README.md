# [Kong](https://getkong.org/) on Cloud.gov

## How to deploy on cloud.gov

Note - this approach was [adapted from this repository](https://github.com/making/cf-kong). This is probably not a production ready way to run Kong, but should allow a way to test it out in the cloud.gov environment. The [Kong Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/kong) is another way to try out Kong APi Gateway.

```
cf create-service aws-rds shared-psql kong-db
cf push your-kong-app
```

You can swap out `shared-psql` for a [larger Postgres instance](https://cloud.gov/docs/services/relational-database/#plans) based on your needs. You can also adjust the amount of memory used by the app by changing the setting in the `manifest.yml` file.

port `8080` is used for incoming HTTP traffic from your clients. You can access this endpoint via `https://your-kong-app.app.cloud.gov`.

Port `8081` is used for the Admin API. You can access this endpoint with the following command.

```
cf ssh -N -T -L 8081:localhost:8081 your-kong-app
```

## Map a route to your service

```bash
~$ cf map-route cf-kong app.cloud.gov -n example-api-kong
```

## Add a service in Kong

```bash
~$ curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8081/services --data name=example_service --data url='https://www.google.com/'
